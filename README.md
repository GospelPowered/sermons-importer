# WP Sermons Importer
This plugin is used to import sermons from Joomla [Preachit](https://extensions.joomla.org/extension/preachit)'s exported XML file to WordPress [Sermon Manager](https://wordpress.org/plugins/sermon-manager-for-wordpress/) plugin.

So far it has been used only internally, but it might be useful to you too!

## How to use
1. Download the latest release from here
2. Install in WP as a plugin
3. Click on "Sermons Importer" (child item of "Settings")
4. Select your XML file and click on "Import"

Tip: if you have a lot of sermons, it might seem like nothing is happening, but it is. Just be patient and don't abort page load.
