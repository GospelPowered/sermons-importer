# WP Sermons Importer
This plugin is used to import sermons from Joomla Preachit's exported XML file.

So far it has been used only internally, but it might be useful to you too!

## How to use
1. Download the latest release from here
2. Install in WP as a plugin
3. Click on "Sermons Importer" (child item of "Settings")
4. Select your XML file and click on "Import"

Tip: if you have a lot of sermons, it might seem like nothing is happening, but it is. Just be patient and don't abort page load.
